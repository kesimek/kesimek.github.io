### About the Creator

My name is Katie Simek.  I am a soon-to-be graduate with a Masters in Data Science who returned to school after working in the Hospitality industry for 8 years.  My Bachelor's degree in Hospitality Management with a Business minor is a great foundation for many industries and segments of operations.  I worked various customer service, operational and administrative positions for one of the world's leading entertainment companies.  Throughout my work, I found myself drawn to data, using it to ask questions, answer questions and provide insight to what was going on around me.  My Masters program was a great opportunity to shift my career focus, learning the techincal skills to balance my business and operational experience.  While my projects my not be as polished or sophisticated as others', I bring a wealth of transferrable skills and experience to go along with my interests in continuous learning.
